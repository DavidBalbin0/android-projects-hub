# Android Projects Hub


## Introduction
My journey into Android development began during my college studies, starting from scratch with only a basic knowledge of Kotlin. 
I decided to create a series of projects to track and document my progress in this process.

This repository centralizes these projects, providing a comprehensive overview of my learning journey and progress in Android app development.

## Projects

### [Layouts:](https://github.com/DavidBalbin0/android-layouts)

This project represents my first encounter with Android development during my college classes. 
It was an opportunity to explore and understand basic user interface components, such as Column and Row,
while gaining familiarity with the Android development environment. Throughout the project, 
I focused on understanding the layout and organization of elements on the screen, experimenting with different layouts and design techniques. This experience laid a solid foundation for future projects, providing a fundamental understanding of user interface development in Android.

### [Compose Fundamentals:](https://github.com/DavidBalbin0/android-compose-fundamentals)

In this project, I explored the fundamental components of the Jetpack Compose user interface, focusing on understanding
essential concepts to create dynamic and scalable interfaces. By using various components such as OutlinedTextField, 
Checkbox, and RadioButton, I delved into their functionalities and applicabilities in building interactive user interfaces. 
Additionally, I performed icon customization and user input manipulation.


### [Navigation:](https://github.com/DavidBalbin0/android-navigation)

This project exemplifies the management of screen navigation in Android applications.
Utilizing Jetpack Navigation, it covers everything from simple navigation to passing parameters between screens,
along with implementing transition animations for a visually engaging experience.
Various Jetpack Navigation functionalities were explored, including route definition, screen transitions, and component communication. 
The project also focused on creating a clear and scalable navigation structure.
